1. Visualize data (Import to know how many centroids to choose)
2. Select k
3. Initialize k centroids
3.5. (Select a random point from dataset)
4. See what points are closest to what centroid
4.5. Check Euclidean distance between centroid and dataset points and select lowest
5. Readjust centroid position
6. Loop from step 4
